     class="history-image">

<h3>Artifact Facts</h3>
<p><strong>Material:</strong> Polished river stone</p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> Approximately 4,000 years old</p>
<p><strong>Region:</strong> Central Africa</p>

<h3>Interpretation</h3>
<p>
The River Stone Cutting Tool is an example of early human technology in Central Africa. 
Although it looks simple, it represents an important step in survival and adaptation. 
Early communities depended on tools like this to cut plants, prepare meat, and shape natural materials. 
The stone was carefully selected from a riverbank, where water helped smooth its surface. 
One edge was shaped through repeated grinding against a harder surface to create a sharper working side.
</p>

<p>
The smooth areas and small chips along the edge show that the tool was used many times. 
It was not decorative. It was practical. This object tells us that early communities understood 
how to choose strong materials and how to improve them. It shows knowledge, patience, and skill.
</p>

<p>
This tool also reflects daily life. It may have been used to prepare food or cut plant fibers 
for weaving or shelter building. Tools like this supported cooperation within the community. 
Food preparation, hunting, and building required shared work and knowledge.
</p>

<p>
Even though the object is small, it connects us to human innovation. 
It reminds us that survival depended on observation of nature and understanding of materials. 
This cutting tool shows that early societies developed effective and reliable technology long before metal tools existed.
</p>

<h3>Comparative Notes</h3>
<p>
Similar stone tools have been found in other Central African river regions. 
This suggests that knowledge of tool-making was shared or developed in similar ways across communities.
</p>

<h3>Cautionary Note on Interpretation</h3>
<p>
The exact use of this tool cannot be proven with complete certainty. 
Interpretations are based on wear patterns and comparison with similar archaeological discoveries.

<h2>Palm Stone Grinding Tool</h2>

<img src="../images/collections/palm_stone_grinding_tool.png" 
     alt="Palm stone grinding tool"
     class="history-image">

<h3>Artifact Facts</h3>
<p><strong>Material:</strong> Dense river stone</p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> Approximately 3,500 years old</p>
<p><strong>Region:</strong> Central Africa</p>

<h3>Interpretation</h3>
<p>
The Palm Stone Grinding Tool was likely used in food preparation and material processing. 
Its rounded shape fits naturally in the hand, making it easy to hold and move repeatedly 
against a larger grinding surface. This simple design allowed people to crush seeds, 
roots, and other plant materials into smaller pieces.
</p>

<p>
Polished areas and shallow abrasion marks show long-term use. 
Grinding was an important activity in early communities. 
It allowed people to prepare food more easily and possibly create flour or paste. 
This improved nutrition and helped communities grow stronger.
</p>

<p>
Grinding tools also may have been used to prepare pigments for body decoration 
or ritual use. This shows that the tool had both practical and cultural importance. 
It represents knowledge of plants and natural resources.
</p>

<p>
The tool reflects organized domestic life. Grinding required time and effort. 
It suggests cooperation and shared responsibilities. 
Even though it appears modest, it demonstrates advanced understanding of food processing 
and material transformation.
</p>

<h3>Comparative Notes</h3>
<p>
Similar grinding stones have been discovered across prehistoric African settlements, 
showing consistent food preparation practices.
</p>

<h3>Cautionary Note on Interpretation</h3>
<p>
While wear patterns suggest grinding activity, we cannot identify the exact materials processed.
